    <h2>Why Cooking</h2>
    <p style="width: 50%;">
      So my whole life I did not want and I was denying the nature. I never
      wanted to do girly things and I wasn't finding them fun
    </p>
    <p style="width: 50%;">
      Until that day, until that smile and that smell. It was him, the fucking
      boy that turned upside down everything I was believing in
    </p>
    <p style="width: 50%;">
      So now I love to cook, I love to paint my nails, I like my long hair and I
      fucking know how to make pickles!
    </p>
    <p style="width: 50%;">
      It all started by the desire to do something for this little cute, fucking
      hot and amazing man I met, it all started with one dinner, I thought,
      "Just one, then it will let me go", but no, after one year and few months,
      I am still on it
    </p>
    <p style="width: 50%;">
      So if you will ask me now, "Is the love truly blind", I would answer, "
      Fuck yes!". I would never think, 2 years ago that I would become who I am
      now. You would say, It's the nature", No it's not, I know it!
    </p>
    <p style="width: 50%;">
      Now I am even making my website about cooking, cause, apparently I love
      it!......aaaand I did not want to lose or forget my favourite recipes....
      Or maybe I just love to eat and it's nothing to do with this little man
